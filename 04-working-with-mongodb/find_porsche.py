Your task is to complete the 'porsche_query' function and in particular the query
to find all autos where the manufacturer field matches "Porsche".
Please modify only 'porsche_query' function, as only that will be taken into account.

Your code will be run against a MongoDB instance that we have provided.
If you want to run this code locally on your machine,
you have to install MongoDB and download and insert the dataset.
